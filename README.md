# Bayesian Quantile Regression

Implementation of Bayesian Quantile Regression (BQR) with the use of Stan and R programming languages for a single predictor variable, i.e.,  ***y** = b + w****x*** + Îµ. In constrast to tradition Linear Regression which estimates the conditional mean function, i.e., *E[**y**|**x**]*, BQR can be used to estimate any conditional quantile function of the form *q<sub>p</sub>(**y**|**x**)*, with *p* being the desired percentile. Bayesian inference is possible via the Asymmetric Laplace density function (see Yun & Moyeed, 2001). The **BQR.stan** script contains the Bayesian model can be easily modified to accommodate multiple predictors, while the **quantileRegression.R** script fits a quantile regression with a numerical optimization alogirthm as well as MCMC for a simple data set provided in **data-example.csv**.
